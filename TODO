algorithm ideas

select n word, append n+1 to n, check FOUND list for match, if none found search text for other occurences, append string with match count to FOUND, append (n+2) to (n + (n+1)), repeat until string of x words is checked. iterate to next word and continue

ingest text sample
change format to one word per line
remove punctuation (or don't)
initialize CHECKED list
create first word pattern 
check sample for occurences
add to CHECKED list with count of occurences
